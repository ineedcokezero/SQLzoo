WHERE id = 1012

3. Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.

SELECT go.player,go.teamid,ga.stadium,ga.mdate
  FROM game ga JOIN goal go ON (ga.id=go.matchid)
WHERE teamid = 'GER'

4. Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'

SELECT ga.team1, ga.team2,go.player FROM 
game ga JOIN goal go ON (ga.id = go.matchid)
WHERE go.player LIKE 'Mario%'

5. Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10

SELECT go.player, go.teamid, e.coach,go.gtime
  FROM goal go JOIN eteam e ON (go.teamid = e.id)
 WHERE gtime<=10

6. List the the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.

SELECT ga.mdate, e.teamname FROM
game ga JOIN eteam e ON (ga.team1 = e.id)
WHERE e.coach = 'Fernando Santos'

7. List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

SELECT go.player FROM goal go JOIN game ga ON (go.matchid=ga.id)
WHERE ga.stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

SELECT DISTINCT go.player
  FROM game ga JOIN goal go ON go.matchid = ga.id 
    WHERE (teamid = team1 AND team2 = 'GER') OR (teamid = team2 AND team1= 'GER')

9. Show teamname and the total number of goals scored.

SELECT e.teamname, count(go.player)
  FROM eteam e JOIN goal go ON e.id=go.teamid
GROUP BY teamname

10. Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.

SELECT ga.stadium, count(go.player) FROM
game ga JOIN goal go ON ga.id=go.matchid
GROUP BY stadium

11. For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.

SELECT go.matchid, ga.mdate, count(go.player) FROM goal go JOIN game ga

WHERE team1= 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL'
GROUP BY matchid

12. For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'

SELECT go.matchid, ga.mdate, count(go.player) FROM goal go JOIN game ga ON go.matchid = ga.id
WHERE teamid = 'GER'
GROUP BY matchid

13. List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.

SELECT ga.mdate, ga.team1,
  SUM(CASE WHEN go.teamid=ga.team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1,
  ga.team2,
  sum(CASE WHEN go.teamid=ga.team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
  FROM game ga LEFT JOIN goal go ON go.matchid = ga.id
GROUP BY ga.mdate,go.matchid,ga.team1,ga.team2
